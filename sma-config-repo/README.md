# Spring Microservices in Action - Config Repo
Spring Boot Microservice project.

## Description
The project represents my implementation based on the "Spring Microservices in Action" book.

The project is the Git repository that provides externalized configuration for the principal services: [Licensing Service](https://github.com/mariamihai/sma-licensing-service), [Organization Service](https://github.com/mariamihai/sma-organization-service) 
and [New Organization Service](https://github.com/mariamihai/sma-organization-new-service) via the [Configuration Service](https://github.com/mariamihai/sma-configuration-service).

An overview of all the projects involved can be found [here](https://github.com/mariamihai/sma-overview).

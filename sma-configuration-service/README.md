## Description
The project represents my implementation based on the "Spring Microservices in Action" book.

The project provides externalized configuration for the principal services: [Licensing Service](https://github.com/mariamihai/sma-licensing-service), [Organization Service](https://github.com/mariamihai/sma-organization-service) and [New Organization Service](https://github.com/mariamihai/sma-organization-new-service). 
It uses a [Git repository](https://github.com/mariamihai/sma-config-repo) for the properties files.

An overview of all the projects involved can be found [here](https://github.com/mariamihai/sma-overview).

## Docker images
Automatic building was implemented for the microservices associated with this project.
For simplicity, I am using the build numbers provided by Travis CI as the version number for each different image constructed.

## Implementation details
### Properties
- the name of the application, used by the other services 
```
spring.application.name=config-service
```
- application server port (default value)
```

```
- adding the secret String for encryption as an environment variable
```
encrypt.key=MySuperExtremelySecretKey
```

### Profiles
